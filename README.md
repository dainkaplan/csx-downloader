## Using ##

The easiest way to use it, is to download the simple-build-tool, instead it, and then `compile`/`test`/`one-jar` this app. From the project root, run `sbt` from the commandline to inter the interactive shell, and then run the `compile`/`test`/`one-jar`, each, respectively. All tests should pass. When you run the `one-jar` command, it will prompt you which main-class to use, select the one you want. After this step, you can use the generated jar with `java -jar [/path/to/the/jar/file].jar` at the command line. Enjoy!
